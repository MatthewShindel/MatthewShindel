### Hi there 👋

![Matthew Shindel Banner](/Images/MainBanner.png)

I'm Matthew Shindel, a Junior Front-end software engineer. I specialize in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and Typescript. I've made front-end applications, primarily using React as the framework, though I have made applications in the past only using Javascript. 

You can reach me at my email:
[Matthew@shindel.com](matthew@shindel.com)

Currently, I'm a Front-end Developer for Datafactz, working on making Front-end testing suites for our Decision Intelligence Application. Below, I've included a video demo of my work, going over the testing suites I created.
